                <b>Graphic design</b> is a <a href="Contents">profession</a>,<sup>[2]</sup> 
                <a href="Contents">academic discipline</a><sup>[3][4][5]</sup> and <a href="Contents">applied art</a> whose activity consists in projecting <a href="Contents">visual communications</a> intended to transmit specific messages to social groups,
                 with specific objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> 
                 Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of <a href="Contents">design</a><sup>[1]</sup> and of the fine arts.
                  Its practice involves <a href="Contents">creativity</a>,<a href="Contents"> innovation</a> and <a href="Contents">lateral thinking</a> using manual or <a href="Contents">digital tools</a>,
                   where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

                The role of the <a href="Contents"> graphic designer</a> in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. 
                They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. 
                Usually, graphic design uses the <a href="Content">aesthetics</a> of <a href="Contents">typography</a> and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, 
                and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. 
                The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>

                <a href="Contents">William Addison Dwiggins</a>is often credited with first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:[15]

                    An Enterprising Trades Union
                    … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
                    
                    A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the <a href="Contents">California School of Arts & Crafts</a> advertised a course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught by <a herefFrederick Meyer.<sup>[16]</sup>
