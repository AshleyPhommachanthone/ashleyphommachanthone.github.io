                                        began selling rubber sandals with flowers painted on them.
                                        Tsuji noted the profits gained by adding a cute design to the sandals
                                        and hired cartoonists to design cute characters for his merchandise. 
                                        The company produced a line of character merchandise around gift-giving occasions. 
                                        Hello Kitty was designed by Yuko Shimizu and was added 
                                        to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in 1974.
